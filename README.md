# Webscrping-of-products-prices-using-multiprocessing-
The project involves web scraping of product prices from Amazon and Jumia using multiprocessing and multithreading. Multiprocessing allows parallel task execution across CPU cores, while multithreading further speeds up scraping by handling multiple product pages simultaneously. This improves efficiency and reduces scraping time.
